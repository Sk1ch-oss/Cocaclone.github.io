    <h1>About our company</h1>
    <p>On May 8, 1886, Dr. John Pemberton brought his perfected syrup to Jacobs' Pharmacy in downtown Atlanta where the first glass of Coca‑Cola was poured. From that one iconic drink, we’ve evolved into a total beverage company. More than 2.2 billion servings of our drinks are enjoyed in more than 200 countries and territories each day.</p>
    <p class="two">We are constantly transforming our portfolio, from reducing added sugar in our drinks to bringing innovative new products to market. We seek to positively impact people’s lives, communities and the planet through water replenishment, packaging recycling, sustainable sourcing practices and carbon emissions reductions across our value chain. Together with our bottling partners, we employ more than 700,000 people, helping bring economic opportunity to local communities worldwide.</p>
